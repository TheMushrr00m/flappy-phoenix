# Flappy Phoenix

Flappy Pheonix is a Flappy Bird clone written in Elixir using
[Phoenix LiveView](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view) to
render the game UI from the server.

Try the game on [Heroku](https://flappy-phoenix.herokuapp.com).

# Running it locally

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`
